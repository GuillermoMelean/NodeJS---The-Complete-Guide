# NodeJS---The-Complete-Guide

## <u>Advantage of Node.js</u>
### **Great Language**
Use Javascript - a language witch you need so much in modern web development.
You only need learn one language to frontend and backend.

### **Node.js vs PHP**
With Node.js you don't just write the code that is running on your server, you also write the server itself. The code takes the Incoming Request and routes them to the specific code.
So, Node.js can create a server and (at the same time) can listen to the Incoming Request.
In contrast, PHP needs extra tools (like apache and engins) to do the same operations.

## What is the <u>REPL</u>?
- **R:** Read User Input
- **E:** Evaluate User Input
- **P:** Print Output (Result)
- **W:** Wait for new Input
 
> **_NOTE:_**  It's executed in your command prompt by simply running `node` there ... you can use it as a great playground and to test some piece of code, commands, etc.

## Node.js vs REPL

| Node.js | REPL | 
| --- | ----------- |
| Execute Files | Use the REPL | 
| Used for real apps | Great playground |
| predictable sequence of steps | Execute code as you write it |
